# HW 3.3 - Python List Problems

Using the given program to help create a list of random numbers, create five separate python programs described below. You can iterate through the elements of a list and move the elements around, but cannot use any built-in list functions.

1. python_list_find_number.py - create a function called find_number which will search for and count the number of times a supplied integer will appear in a list
2. python_list_find_maximum.py - create a function called find_maximum(), which will find the maximum integer in a list
3. python_list_find_minimum.py - create a function called find_miniumum(), which will find the minimum integer in a list
4. python_list_partition.py - create a function called partition(), which will take in some integer value and place all of the elements which are smaller on one side of the list, leaving the larger elements on the other (this is like the sort below, but the order of the smaller and larger elements does not matter)
5. python_list_sort.py - create a funchtion called sort(), which will sort the list from smallest to largest.
